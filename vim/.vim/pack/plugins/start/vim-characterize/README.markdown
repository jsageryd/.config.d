# characterize.vim

In Vim, pressing `ga` on a character reveals its representation in decimal,
octal, and hex.  Characterize.vim modernizes this with the following
additions:

* Unicode character names: `U+00A9 COPYRIGHT SYMBOL`
* Vim digraphs (type after `<C-K>` to insert the character): `Co`, `cO`
* [Emoji codes](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/): `:copyright:`
* HTML entities: `&copy;`

## Installation

Install using your favorite package manager, or use Vim's built-in package
support:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/tpope/start
    cd ~/.vim/pack/tpope/start
    git clone https://tpope.io/vim/characterize
    vim -u NONE -c "helptags characterize/doc" -c q
