Configuring
-----------

To use a custom python binary:

    let g:wakatime_PythonBinary = '/usr/bin/python'

The default is to use `python` from your system PATH.

WakaTime plugins share a common config file `.wakatime.cfg` located in your user home directory with [these options](https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime#configuring) available.

Uninstalling
------------

Remove `Bundle 'wakatime/vim-wakatime'` from your `.vimrc` file, then delete your `~/.wakatime.cfg` config file.
