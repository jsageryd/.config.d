# Regular config and tweaks
- Set up ~/.config/nvim/init.lua as desired.

# Plugins
## nvim-tree
- nvim-tree is like NERDTree
- Clone to ~/.config/nvim/start/nvim-tree.lua
- Configure in ~/.config/nvim/init.lua

# LSP
- Install `gopls`
- In ~/.config/nvim/lsp/go.lua configure the LSP
- In ~/.config/nvim/init.lua enable the LSP: `vim.lsp.enable('go')`

# tree-sitter

- Tree-sitter seems to come with neovim, at least the one I have.
- Go grammar is needed for Go. Download tree-sitter-go, run `tree-sitter build`
- Put go.dylib from the build in ~/.config/nvim/parser/
- No further configuration seems to be needed.
